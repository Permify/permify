title: Recursive Relationships

With Permify schema language, you can define recursive relationship-based permissions within the same entity.

As an example, consider a system where there are multiple organizations within a company, some of which may have a parent-child relationship between them.

As expected, organization members are also granted permission to view their organization details. You can model that as follows:

```perm
entity user {}

entity organization {
    relation parent @organization
    relation member @user @organization#member

    action view = member or parent.member
}
```

Let's extend the scenario by adding a rule allowing parent organization members to view details of child organizations. Specifically, a member of **Organization Alpha** could view the details of **Organization Beta** if **Organization Beta** belongs to **Organization Alpha**.

First authorization schema that we provide won't solve this issue because `parent.member` accommodate single upward traversal in a hierarchy.

Instead of `parent.member` we can call the parent view permission on the same entity - `parent.view` to achieve multiple levels of upward traversal, as follows:

```perm
entity user {}

entity organization {
    relation parent @organization
    relation member @user @organization#member

    action view = member or parent.view
}
```

This way, we achieve a recursive relationship between parent-child organizations.
