# Overview

Permify API provides various functionalities around authorization such as performing access checks, reading and writing relation tuples, expanding your permissions (schema actions), and more.

We structured Permify API in 3 core parts; ***modeling authorization***, ***storing authorization data*** and ***enforcement***. Therefore, Permify API has sections that represent the functionalities of these core parts.

- **Permission Section**: Consist enforcement requests and options.
- **Relationship Section**: Authorization data operations such as creating, deleting and reading relational tuples.
- **Schema Section**: Modeling and Permify Schema related functionalities including configuration and auditing.

Permify exposes its APIs via both [gRPC](https://buf.build/permify/permify/docs/main:base.v1) and [REST](https://restfulapi.net/).
