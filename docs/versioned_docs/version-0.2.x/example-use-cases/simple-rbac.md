# Role Based Access Control

Want to implement role and permissions to your application ? Permify fully covers you at that point. Below example shows how to model simple role based access control for organizational roles and permissions with Permify's DSL, [Permify Schema].

[Permify Schema]: ../../getting-started/modeling

-------

## Full Schema

```perm
entity user {} 

entity organization {

    //roles 
    relation admin @user    
    relation member @user    
    relation manager @user    
    relation agent @user  

    //organization files access permissions
    action view_files = admin or manager or (member and not agent)
    action edit_files = admin or manager
    action delete_file = admin 

    //vendor files access permissions
    action view_vendor_files = admin or manager or agent
    action edit_vendor_files = admin or agent
    action delete_vendor_file = agent

} 
```

## Schema Deconstruction

### Entities

This schema consists 2 entities, 

- `user`, represents users (maybe corresponds as employees). This entity is empty because it's only responsible for referencing users.

```perm
  entity user {}
```

- `organization`, representing the organization the user (employees) belongs. It has several roles and permissions related to the specific resources such as organization files and vendor files.

### Relations

#### organization entity

We can use **relations** to define roles. In this example, we have 4 organizational wide roles, respectively; admin, manager, member, and agent. 

```perm
entity organization {

    //roles 
    relation admin @user    
    relation member @user    
    relation manager @user 
    relation agent @user     

}
```

Roles (relations) can be scoped with different kinds of entities. But for simplicity, we follow a multi-tenancy approach, which demonstrates each organization has its own roles.

### Actions

Actions describe what relations, or relationâ€™s relation can do, think of actions as entities' permissions. Actions defines who can perform a specific action in which circumstances.

Permify Schema supports ***and***, ***or***, ***and not*** and ***or not*** operators to define actions. 

#### organization actions

In our schema, we define several actions for controlling access permissions on organization files and organization vendor's files.

```perm
entity organization {

    //organization files access permissions
    action view_files = admin or manager or (member and not agent)
    action edit_files = admin or manager
    action delete_file = admin 

    //vendor files access permissions
    action view_vendor_files = admin or manager or agent
    action edit_vendor_files = admin or agent
    action delete_vendor_file = agent

} 
```

let's take a look at some of the actions:

- ``action edit_files = admin or manager`` 
indicates that only the admin or manager has permission to edit files in the organization.

- ``action view_files = admin or manager or (member and not agent)``
indicates that the admin, manager, or members (without having the agent role) can view organization files.



## Example Relational Tuples for this case

organization:2#admin@user:daniel

organization:5#member@user:ashley

organization:17#manager@user:mert

organization:21#agent@user:ege
