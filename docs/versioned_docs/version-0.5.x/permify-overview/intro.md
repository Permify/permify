# What is Permify?

[Permify](https://github.com/Permify/permify) is an **open source authorization service** for creating fine-grained and scalable authorization systems.

With Permify, you can easily structure your authorization model, store authorization data in your preferred database, and interact with the Permify API to handle all authorization queries from your applications or services.

Permify is inspired by Google‚Äôs consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar](https://www.permify.co/post/google-zanzibar-in-a-nutshell/).

### Motivation

Our goal is to make **Google's Zanzibar** available to everyone and help them to build robust, flexible, and easily auditable authorization system that establishes a [natural linkage between permissions](https://www.permify.co/post/power-of-relational-based-access-control/) across the business units, functions, and entities of an organization.

## Key Features

üõ°Ô∏è **Production ready** authorization API that serve as **gRPC** and **REST**.

üîÆ Domain Specific Authorization Language to **easily model** your authorization. SUpporting RBAC, ReBAC, ABAC and more.

üîê Database Configuration to store your permissions with **high availability** and **low latency**.

‚úÖ Perform access control checks and get answers **down to 10ms** with our various cache mechanisms that we operate.

üí™ Battle tested, robust **authorization architecture and data model** based on [Google Zanzibar](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf).

‚öôÔ∏è Create custom permissions for your **tenants**, and manage them in a single place with **Multi Tenancy**.

‚ö° Analyze **performance and behavior** of your authorization with tracing tools [jaeger], [signoz] or [zipkin].f

## Getting Started

In Permify, authorization is divided into 3 core aspects; **modeling**, **storing authorization data** and **access checks**.  

- See how to [Model your Authorization] using Permify Schema.
- Learn how Permify will [Store Authorization Data] as relations.
- Perform [Access Checks] anywhere in your stack.

[Model your Authorization]: ../../getting-started/modeling
[Store Authorization Data]: ../../getting-started/sync-data
[Access Checks]: ../../getting-started/enforcement

This document explains how Permify handles these aspects to provide a robust and scalable authorization system for your applications. For the ones that want to try it out and examine it instantly,
