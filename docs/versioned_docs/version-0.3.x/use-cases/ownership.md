# Ownership 

Granting privileges to the owner of the resource is a common pattern that many applications follow. Generally we want creators of the resource - document, post, comment etc -  have superior power on that resource. Check out the below model see how ownership can be modeled with our authorization language, [Permify Schema].

[Permify Schema]: ../getting-started/modeling

Before we get started, here's the final schema that we will create in this tutorial.

```perm
entity user {}

entity comment {

	// represents comment's owner
	relation owner @user

	// permissions 
	action edit = owner
    action delete = owner
}

```

## Sample Relational Tuples 

comment:2#owner@user:1

comment:3#owner@user:51
