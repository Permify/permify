# Common Use Cases

Common modeling patterns and uses cases we have seen so far from the users from small startups with simple RBAC to multi-regional enterprises that run tens of Permify instances with deeply nested relationships.

:::success Missing a specific use case?
No problem, let's discuss it together! just open an [issue](https://github.com/Permify/permify/issues) about it or join our conversation at [discord](https://discord.gg/n6KfzYxhPp)!

```mdx-code-block
import {CaseList} from '@site/src/components/Case';
import list from './use-cases/_list.json';

<CaseList list={list}/>
```
