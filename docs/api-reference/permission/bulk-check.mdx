The Bulk Check API allows you to check multiple permissions in a single request, significantly reducing network overhead and improving performance when you need to verify multiple access control decisions at once.

**Key Benefits:**

- Check up to 100 permissions in a single API call
- Reduce network round trips by batching multiple checks
- All checks are evaluated against the same snapshot of your authorization data

<Info>
  The bulk check is particularly useful for UI permission checks, where you need
  to verify access for multiple resources at once (e.g., showing/hiding buttons
  for multiple items in a list).
