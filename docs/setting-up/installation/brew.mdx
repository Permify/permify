title: Install with Brew
---

This section shows how to install and run Permify Service using brew. 

### Install Permify

Open terminal and run the following line,

```shell
brew install permify/tap/permify
```

### Run Permify Service 

To run the Permify Service, `permify serve` command should be run.

By default, the service is configured to listen on ports 3476 (HTTP) and 3478 (gRPC) and store the authorization data in memory rather then an actual database. You can override these by running the command with configuration flags. 

### Configure By Using Flags

See all the configuration flags by running,

```shell
permify serve --help
```

<Note>
In addition to CLI flags, Permify also supports configuration via environment variables. You can replace any flag with an environment variable by converting dashes into underscores and prefixing with PERMIFY_ (e.g. **--log-level** becomes **PERMIFY_LOG_LEVEL**). 
</Note>


### Configure With Using Config File

You can also configure Permify Service by using a configuration file.

```shell
 permify serve -c=config.yaml
```

or 

```shell
 permify serve --config=config.yaml
```

### Test your connection

You can test your connection by making an HTTP GET request,

```shell
localhost:3476/healthz
```

You can use our Postman Collection to work with the API. Also see the [Using the API] section for details of core functions.
