## What is Permify ?

[Permify](https://github.com/Permify/permify) is an **open-source authorization service** for creating fine-grained and scalable authorization systems.

With Permify, you can easily structure your authorization model, store authorization data in your preferred database, and interact with the Permify API to handle all authorization queries from your applications or services.

Permify is inspired by Google‚Äôs consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar](https://permify.co/post/google-zanzibar-in-a-nutshell/).

## Motivation

Building scalable authorization systems is hard and time-consuming, and we're here to eliminate the authorization burden for devs. 

Our goal is to make Google‚Äôs Zanzibar available to everyone and help engineering teams build a robust, flexible, and easily auditable authorization systems.

Permify centrally position itself in your environment as a service, which consists 

- [Permission Database](/getting-started/sync-data) to store your policies and related authorization data in a structured way.
- [Policy decision point (PDP)](/getting-started/enforcement) to evaluate authorization queries - such as access checks - according to the data.

See the [Authorization As A Service](./authorization-service) section to learn why building authorization is challenging and how our approach significantly reduces engineering efforts and secures future-proof access control systems.

## With Permify, you can:

üìç **Centralize & Standardize Your Authorization** - Abstract your authorization logic from your codebase and application logic to easily reason, test, and debug your authorization. Treat your authorization as a sole entity and move faster within your core development.

üîÆ **Build Granular Permissions For Any Case You Have** - You can create granular (resource-specific, hierarchical, context aware, etc) permissions and policies using Permify's domain specific language that is compatible with RBAC, ReBAC and ABAC.

üõ¢Ô∏è **Manage and Store Authorization Data** - Store authorization-related data as structured relationships to efficiently manage large data volumes and achieve blazing fast response times.

‚úÖ **Interact with Easy to Use APIs** - Use Permify APIs to perform access checks, filter your resources with specific permissions, perform bulk permission checks for various resources, and more.

üîê **Set Custom Authorization For Your Tenants** - Set up isolated authorization logic and custom permissions for your vendors/organizations (tenants) and manage them in a single place.


## Getting Started

In Permify, authorization is divided into 3 core aspects; **modeling**, **storing authorization data** and **interacting with the APIs**.  

- See how to [Model your Authorization] using Permify Schema.
- Learn how Permify will [Store Authorization Data] as relationships.
- Perform [Access Checks] anywhere in your stack.

[Model your Authorization]: ../getting-started/modeling
[Store Authorization Data]: ../getting-started/sync-data
[Access Checks]: ../getting-started/enforcement
