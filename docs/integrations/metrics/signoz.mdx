Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) for export Permify traces.

### Step 1: Install SigNoz in Your Environment

You can install SigNoz via Docker. Run the following command to set up SigNoz:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

Once the installation is complete, you can access the SigNoz dashboard at `http://localhost:3301`.

### Step 2: Configure Permify for SigNoz Tracing

In your configuration file, set up SigNoz as the exporter and provide the appropriate endpoint for exporting the traces.

Here’s an example configuration:

```yaml
tracer:
  exporter: signoz
  endpoint: http://localhost:4317
  enabled: true
  insecure: true
```

Explanation:
- `exporter: signoz`: Specifies that SigNoz will be used as the exporter.
- `endpoint: http://localhost:4317`: This is the default SigNoz OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint.
- `enabled: true`: Turns on the tracing feature.
- `insecure: true`: Enables HTTP instead of HTTPS for exporting traces.

<Info>
Refer to the [Configuration](/setting-up/configuration) section for more details on how to use the configuration file. You can also use environment variables (ENVs) for this.

### Step 3: Start Permify with SigNoz Configuration

Ensure your configuration file is correctly loaded when starting Permify, and verify that the SigNoz instance is running. Permify will now start sending tracing data to SigNoz.

### Step 4: View Traces in the SigNoz Dashboard

Once the setup is complete and your application starts sending requests, you can access the SigNoz dashboard at `http://localhost:3301` to observe the traces related to your authorization system.

### Optional: Use Secure Connection

If you need to use HTTPS for secure communication with SigNoz, adjust the configuration as follows:

```yaml
tracer:
  exporter: signoz
  endpoint: https://your-signoz-endpoint
  enabled: true
  insecure: false
```

This sets up a secure connection for exporting traces to SigNoz.
