![Permify - Open source authorization as a service](https://github.com/Permify/permify/assets/39353278/06262e07-84ba-4a1c-b859-870344396600)

## What is Permify?

[Permify](https://github.com/Permify/permify) is a open-source authorization service for creating and managing fine-grained permissions in your applications and services. Inspired by Google‚Äôs consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf)

Our goal is to make Google's Zanzibar available to everyone and help them build robust, flexible, and easily auditable authorization systems that perform well in scaled environments.

### With Permify, you can:

üîÆ Create permissions and policies using [Permify's flexible authorization language](https://docs.permify.co/docs/getting-started/modeling) that is compatible with traditional roles and permissions (RBAC), arbitrary relations between users and objects (ReBAC), and attributes (ABAC).

üîê [Manage and store authorization data](https://docs.permify.co/docs/getting-started/sync-data) in your preferred database with high availability and consistency.

‚úÖ [Interact with the Permify API](https://docs.permify.co/docs/getting-started/enforcement) to perform access checks, filter your resources with specific permissions, perform bulk permission checks for various resources, and more.

üß™ Test your authorization logic with [Permify's schema testing](https://docs.permify.co/docs/getting-started/testing). You can conduct scenario-based testing, policy coverage analysis, and IDL parser integration to achieve end-to-end validations for your desired authorization schema.

‚öôÔ∏è Create custom and isolated authorization models for different applications using Permify [Multi-Tenancy](https://docs.permify.co/docs/use-cases/multi-tenancy) support, all managed within a single place, Permify instance.

## Getting Started 

- Follow a guide to model your authorization using [Permify's Authorization Language].
- See our [Playground], build your authorization logic and test it with sample data.
- Explore overview of [Permify API] and learn how to interact with it.
