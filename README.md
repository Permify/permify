## What is Permify?

[Permify](https://github.com/Permify/permify) is an open-source authorization service for easily building and managing fine-grained, scalable, and extensible access controls for your applications and services. Inspired by Google‚Äôs consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf)

Our service makes authorization more secure and adaptable to changing needs, allowing you to get it up and running in just a few minutes to a couple of days‚Äîno need to spend months building out entire piece of infrastructure.

It works in run time and can respond to any type of access control checks (can user X view document Y?, which posts can members of team Y edit?, etc.) from any of your apps and services in tens of milliseconds.

### With Permify, you can:

üß™ **Centralize & Standardize Your Authorization**: Abstract your authorization logic from your codebase and application logic to easily reason, test, and debug your authorization. Behave your authorization as a sole entity and move faster with in your core development.

üîÆ **Build Granular Permissions For Any Case You Have:** You can create granular (resource-specific, hierarchical, context aware, etc) permissions and policies using Permify's domain specific language that is compatible with RBAC, ReBAC and ABAC.

üîê **Set Authorization For Your Tenants By Default**: Set up isolated authorization logic and custom permissions for your vendors/organizations (tenants) and manage them in a single place.

üöÄ **Scale Your Authorization As You Wish:** Achieve lightning-fast response times down to 10ms for access checks with a proven infrastructure inspired by Google Zanzibar.
